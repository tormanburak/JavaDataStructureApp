1-)From the data collected for the three-while loop algorithm, it seems that each time the file
size gets incremented, the time it takes to analyze also increases, it looks like it has a O(n)

2-) From the data collected for the one-while loop algorithm, it seems that each time the file
size gets incremented, the time it takes to analyze also increases but it is significantly 
lower than the three while loop, it looks like it has a O(logn).

conclusion-
One while-loop algorithm is more efficent than three-while loop algortihm.
